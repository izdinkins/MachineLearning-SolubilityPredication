# ðŸ’§ Predicting Molecular Solubility (LogS) using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the solubility (LogS) of chemical compounds using molecular descriptors. It is my first machine learning project built using Python in Google Colab.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- Source: [Data Professor GitHub](https://github.com/dataprofessor/data)
- File: `delaney_solubility_with_descriptors.csv`
- Target: `logS` (Log of solubility)
- Features: Molecular descriptors (e.g., MolWt, MolLogP, NumRotatableBonds, etc.)

## ðŸ§ª Project Steps

1. **Load the dataset** from a public URL.
2. **Prepare the data** by separating features (X) and the target variable (y).
3. **Split the data** into training and testing sets.
4. **Train models** using:
   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest Regressor
5. **Evaluate models** using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).
6. **Compare performance** of both models.
7. **Visualize predictions** to assess accuracy.
